# Papers we Love, Lagos

This is the repository for the Lagos, Nigeria chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/nashville/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Information

The Lagos chapter of Papers we love is a fledgling community started in the middle of 2024, embodying the culture of all Papers we love chapters. We're passionate about papers in Computer Science, and constantly seek opportunities to share ideas in both the theoretical and practical domain of CS.
